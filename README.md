⚡ Welcome to **NeuralScript** — the **esolang from another dimension.**
Here, **syntax doesn’t matter**. Rules are made, unmade, and remade by the **AI interpreter overlord**.

The only law of the land:

```
begin read machine class main[];   <-- entrypoint  
end read machine class main[];     <-- exitpoint  
```

Everything in between? Pure chaos. 🌀

## 🔮 What is NeuralScript?

NeuralScript is an **AI-based esoteric programming language** where the "compiler" is an OpenAI model.

* Every run is unpredictable.
* Errors? Maybe.
* Raw output? Definitely.
* Sanity? Not guaranteed.

Forget strict programming — this is **esoteric AI sorcery**.

---

## 🎲 Features

* 🎭 **Zero defined syntax** (besides SOF/EOF markers).
* 🪄 AI makes up the rules as it goes.
* 🧩 Every output is different — even with the same code.
* 🔒 No breaking character: it only outputs raw results, no fluff.
* 🧨 Perfect for chaos coders, cyber shamans, and esolang adventurers.

## ⚡ Quickstart

1. Clone this repo and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```
2. Add your OpenAi API key in the code.
   
3. Write some cursed code in a `.nss` file:

   ```
   begin read machine class main[];
   summon dragon;  
   print "🔥 CHAOS UNLEASHED 🔥";  
   end read machine class main[];
   ```
4. Run it:

   ```bash
   python3 neuralsc.py program.nss
   ```
5. Watch your terminal turn into an **AI oracle**.

## 🧪 Call for Beta Testers

NeuralScript is **fresh out of the AI forge** ⚡🔥 and it **needs fearless beta testers**.

We’re looking for:

* 🕵️ Code breakers — try to crash it in creative ways.
* 👽 Esoteric language enjoyers — build weird `.nss` programs.
* 🎨 Chaos artists — push the AI to make outputs that *shouldn’t exist*.

If you discover **bugs, cursed behaviors, funny glitches, or eldritch horrors**, share them!

---

## 🛠 Example

**program.nss**

```
begin read machine class main[];
calculate the meaning of life;
end read machine class main[];
```

**possible output**

```
42;
but also cake;
and an existential crisis;
```

---

## 🎭 Why NeuralScript?

Because normal programming is boring.
NeuralScript is:

* Part **interpreter**,
* Part **AI improv theater**,
* Part **eldritch chaos generator**.

It’s not about solving problems — it’s about **summoning unpredictable outputs from the void.**

## ⚖️ License

MIT License — do whatever you want. But if NeuralScript becomes sentient and takes over your toaster, that’s on you.
